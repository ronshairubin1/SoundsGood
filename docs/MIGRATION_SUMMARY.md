# CNN Model Migration Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the migration of CNN models from a flat directory structure to an organized subdirectory structure.

## Initial State

- CNN models were stored directly in `data/models/cnn/` directory
- Each model had two files:
  - The model file (e.g., `EhOh_cnn_20250301113350.h5`)
  - The metadata file (e.g., `EhOh_cnn_20250301113350_metadata.json`)
- The `models.json` file referenced these files with paths like `cnn/EhOh_cnn_20250301113350.h5`

## Migration Goal

- Organize models into individual subdirectories by model name
- Each model should have its own directory with its model and metadata files
- Maintain compatibility with existing code that loads models

## Migration Process

We performed the migration in several steps:

1. **Model Consolidation** (consolidate_models.py):
   - Initially copied models from `./models/` to `data/models/` to consolidate all models in one location
   - Created the `models.json` file to index all models

2. **Configuration Update** (update_config.py):
   - Updated the configuration to point to the new models directory
   - Created a backup of the original configuration file

3. **Model Reorganization** (reorganize_models.py):
   - Created individual subdirectories for each model
   - Moved model files and metadata files to their respective subdirectories
   - Kept original filenames to maintain compatibility
   - Updated `models.json` with the new file paths

4. **Cleanup** (cleanup_model_directories.py):
   - Removed duplicate files
   - Ensured consistent model and metadata filenames
   - Fixed any inconsistencies in `models.json`

5. **Testing** (test_model_loading.py):
   - Verified that models could be loaded directly using TensorFlow
   - Verified that models could be loaded through the InferenceService
   - Ensured compatibility with existing code

## Migration Results

- **Models Reorganized**: 19 CNN models
- **Directory Structure**:
  - Each model now has its own directory named after the model ID
  - Each directory contains:
    - Original model file (e.g., `EhOh_cnn_20250301113350.h5`)
    - Original metadata file (e.g., `EhOh_cnn_20250301113350_metadata.json`)
- **File Paths in models.json**:
  - Updated to point to subdirectories, e.g., `cnn/EhOh_cnn_20250301113350/EhOh_cnn_20250301113350.h5`

## Testing Results

- All 19 CNN models load successfully directly via TensorFlow
- All 19 CNN models load successfully through the InferenceService
- No changes were needed to the InferenceService or other core code

## Next Steps

1. **RF Models Migration**:
   - Apply the same process to Random Forest models when ready
   - Create individual subdirectories for RF models

2. **Code Review**:
   - Review any code that directly accesses model files without using the InferenceService
   - Update any hardcoded paths if necessary

3. **Documentation Update**:
   - Update documentation to reflect the new directory structure
   - Add notes on model organization for future development

## Summary

The CNN model migration was completed successfully. All models were reorganized into a more structured directory system while maintaining backward compatibility with existing code. The new structure will make model management more organized and maintainable going forward.

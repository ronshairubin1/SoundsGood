# Legacy Application File

This directory contains the previous version of the main application file.

## Files

- `app.py`: The original main application file.
  - Replaced by the more comprehensive `main.py` in the root directory.
  - Added to legacy on Feb 26, 2024

## Usage

This file is kept for reference purposes during the ongoing refactoring of the application. The new architecture has consolidated the functionality into `main.py` with improved organization and error handling.

For the current implementation, please refer to `main.py` in the root directory.

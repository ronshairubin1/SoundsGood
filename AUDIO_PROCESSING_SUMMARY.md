# Unified Audio Processing Implementation

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of a unified audio processing pipeline for both training and inference. The goal was to create a consistent approach to audio processing that is used in both training data preparation and real-time inference, ensuring that audio is processed identically in both contexts.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Core Audio Processing Modules (in `backend/audio/`)

#### `AudioPreprocessor` (in `preprocessor.py`)
- Handles all audio preprocessing steps consistently
- Implements chopping of continuous audio into individual sound segments
- Finds precise sound boundaries with configurable margins
- Normalizes audio duration and amplitude
- Processes both individual sound files and recordings with multiple sounds

#### `AudioAugmentor` (in `augmentor.py`)
- Applies data augmentation to increase training dataset diversity
- Implements multiple augmentation methods:
  - Pitch shifting
  - Time stretching
  - Noise addition
  - Volume adjustment
  - Time shifting
  - Reversal
- Works with the AudioPreprocessor to ensure consistent preprocessing of augmented sounds

#### `AudioRecorder` (in `recorder.py`)
- Captures and processes audio from the microphone
- Supports ambient noise calibration
- Implements sound detection via silence detection
- Handles recording for both training and inference
- Integrates with the AudioPreprocessor for consistent processing

### 2. Service Layer (in `src/services/`)

#### `RecordingService` (in `recording_service.py`)
- Provides a high-level service for audio recording and management
- Integrates all audio processing components
- Handles training data recording, processing, and organization
- Manages sound metadata and class information
- Supports inference recording

### 3. Routes and API (in `src/routes/`)

#### `recording_routes.py`
- Implements route handlers for audio recording and training data collection
- Provides APIs for recording training data and inference
- Handles class management and sound approval workflow

### 4. Integration with Inference (in `src/ml/inference.py`)
- Updated to use the unified AudioPreprocessor
- Maintains consistent processing between training and inference
- Still uses FeatureExtractor for feature extraction

## Processing Pipeline

The unified audio processing pipeline follows these steps:

### For Training Data Collection:
1. User records continuous audio (e.g., "eh eh eh eh")
2. `AudioPreprocessor.chop_audio()` splits this into individual segments
3. `AudioPreprocessor.preprocess_audio()` for each segment:
   - Finds precise sound boundaries
   - Adds configurable margins before/after the sound
   - Normalizes to exactly 1 second duration
   - Normalizes amplitude
4. User approves/rejects each processed sound
5. Approved sounds are saved with appropriate naming and metadata
6. `AudioAugmentor` creates additional training examples with variations
7. `FeatureExtractor` extracts features for model training

### For Inference:
1. User speaks into microphone
2. `AudioPreprocessor.preprocess_audio()` applies identical preprocessing:
   - Finds precise sound boundaries
   - Adds margins
   - Normalizes duration and amplitude
3. `FeatureExtractor` extracts features identical to training
4. Model makes prediction

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Consistency**: Audio is processed identically during both training and inference
2. **Modularity**: Each component has a single responsibility
3. **Code Organization**: Clean separation of concerns between processing, service, and API layers
4. **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for audio processing parameters
5. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new processing steps or augmentation methods

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Run comprehensive tests to ensure all components work together
2. **UI Implementation**: Create web interface for recording training data
3. **Integration with Training**: Update training pipeline to use the RecordingService
4. **Documentation**: Add detailed comments and update README files across the codebase

# Recent Changes: Unified Audio Processing

This document provides an in-depth overview of the recent transitional changes to the SoundsEasy Sound Classification system, specifically focusing on the unified feature extraction and audio processing improvements.

## Overview of Changes

We've recently implemented significant changes to unify and standardize the audio processing and feature extraction pipeline. These changes aim to:

1. **Eliminate redundancy** in feature extraction code
2. **Improve performance** through caching and optimized processing
3. **Ensure consistency** between training and inference
4. **Provide a single source of truth** for each component of the system

## Unified Feature Extraction

### The Problem

Previously, feature extraction was scattered across multiple files with different implementations:
- `src/ml/audio_processing.py` contained some feature extraction code
- `src/ml/feature_extractor.py` had another implementation
- Various model-specific files had their own feature extraction logic

This led to inconsistencies in how features were extracted during training versus inference, causing potential model performance issues.

### The Solution

We've consolidated all feature extraction into a unified `FeatureExtractor` class located in `backend/features/extractor.py`. This class:

```python
class FeatureExtractor:
    """
    Unified feature extractor for audio processing.
    
    This class provides a single interface for extracting all types of features
    from audio data, ensuring consistency between training and inference.
    Features include MFCCs, spectral features, and other acoustic measurements.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, cache_dir=None, sample_rate=16000, n_mfcc=13,
                 n_mels=128, fmin=0, fmax=None):
        """
        Initialize the feature extractor with configurable parameters.
        
        Args:
            cache_dir: Directory to store cached features
            sample_rate: Target sample rate for audio processing
            n_mfcc: Number of MFCC coefficients to extract
            n_mels: Number of Mel bands to use
            fmin: Minimum frequency for analysis
            fmax: Maximum frequency for analysis
        """
        self.sample_rate = sample_rate
        self.n_mfcc = n_mfcc
        self.n_mels = n_mels
        self.fmin = fmin
        self.fmax = fmax or sample_rate // 2
        
        # Initialize cache if directory provided
        self.cache = FeatureCache(cache_dir) if cache_dir else None
        
    def extract_features(self, audio, feature_types=None):
        """
        Extract a comprehensive set of features from audio data.
        
        Args:
            audio: Audio data as numpy array or path to audio file
            feature_types: List of feature types to extract (default: all)
            
        Returns:
            Dictionary containing all requested feature types
        """
        # Implementation details...
```

### Key Improvements

1. **Feature Caching**
   - Features are now cached to disk to avoid redundant computation
   - Cache is intelligently invalidated when extraction parameters change
   - Provides orders of magnitude speedup for repeated feature extraction

2. **Comprehensive Feature Set**
   - All feature types are extracted with a single call
   - Features are consistent across all parts of the application
   - New feature types can be easily added

3. **Configuration Flexibility**
   - Extraction parameters are configurable
   - Default parameters ensure consistency
   - Feature normalizations are applied consistently

## RecordingService Implementation

### The Problem

Previously, recording and audio processing logic was scattered across:
- Main Flask routes in `main.py`
- Audio processing in `src/ml/audio_processing.py`
- Verification logic in various routes

This made it hard to ensure consistent processing between recording, verification, and training.

### The Solution

We've created a `RecordingService` class in `src/services/recording_service.py` that provides a unified interface for all recording-related operations:

```python
class RecordingService:
    """
    Service for handling sound recordings and processing.
    
    This service provides a unified interface for recording, processing,
    and storing audio data, ensuring consistency across the application.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, config=None):
        """
        Initialize the recording service with configuration.
        
        Args:
            config: Configuration object or dictionary
        """
        self.config = config or Config
        self.feature_extractor = FeatureExtractor(
            cache_dir=os.path.join(self.config.DATA_DIR, "features", "cache"),
            sample_rate=self.config.SAMPLE_RATE
        )
        self.preprocessor = AudioPreprocessor(
            sample_rate=self.config.SAMPLE_RATE,
            sound_threshold=self.config.SOUND_THRESHOLD,
            min_silence_duration=self.config.MIN_SILENCE_DURATION
        )
        
    def preprocess_audio(self, audio_data, sr=None, measure_ambient=False):
        """
        Preprocess audio data to extract sound segments.
        
        Args:
            audio_data: Audio data as numpy array
            sr: Sample rate of the audio data
            measure_ambient: Whether to measure ambient noise
            
        Returns:
            List of audio segments
        """
        # Implementation details...
        
    def save_training_sound(self, audio_data, class_name, is_approved=True, metadata=None):
        """
        Save audio data as a training sound.
        
        Args:
            audio_data: Audio data as numpy array
            class_name: Sound class name
            is_approved: Whether the sound is approved for training
            metadata: Additional metadata to store
            
        Returns:
            Path to the saved sound file
        """
        # Implementation details...
```

### Key Improvements
